Mongoose Connection Manager
==================

Keeps track of many different named Mongoose and provides easy access to them.


Running Tests
=============

First you'll need to have `mongod` running on the default port (`27017`)

Then you can run:

    coffee test.coffee

If anything is wrong, you should see the error details on the console. If everything passes you should see something like this:

    OK
